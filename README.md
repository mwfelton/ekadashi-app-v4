# Ekadashi Fast tracker app

A little app project I've been wanting to build for a while, sending users reminders of what day is Ekadashi, when to fast, and to progress further providing user log ins where people can track their fasts and also other yoga related activities.

Building with React Native, expo, Zustand for state management, possible firebase for storing data.
